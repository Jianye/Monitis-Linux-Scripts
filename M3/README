M3 => MMM => Monitis Monitor Manager
This is a utility that would help you to manage monitors in Monitis
Have a look at config_sample.xml and Example.pl to understand how to operate
it.

NagiosToM3Converter.pl will convert a nagios configuration to M3 - still work in progress

M3 helper scripts:
AddMonitors.pl - Adds all the monitors into Monitis, so later on data can be
	inserted into their counters. It is mandatory to run this before you use Run.pl
	or invoke_agents()
Run.pl - Executes all agents, then sends the monitoring data to Monitis.
DryRun.pl - Same as Run.pl, however does not send monitoring data to Monitis.
	Can be used to debug your parsing.

M3 has a plugin architecture. 2 types of plugins exist:
 1. Execution
 2. Parsing
And they sit in the Execution and Parsing directories respectively.
